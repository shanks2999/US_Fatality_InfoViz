        <p> The above visualization represents the amount of different wearable electronics devices used.<br><br>
            The data set provides information on the companies, whose devices are being used the most (Garmin) and
            highlights the body part on which the most devices are used(wrist in this case)</p>
        <p> The chart also compares the different companies making the devices. Another point of interest is that across all the body parts,
            we can infer the part on which most money is being spent on (hands).</p><br>
        <p>There is also an interactive visualization on the same. You can click the image to view it. </p>
